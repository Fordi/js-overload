= Javascript Overloader

The simple purpose of this library is to allow call signature based overloading similar to that you find in Java and Objective C in the context of Javascript, as well as permit the use
of enforced strong typing without sacrificing the basic flexibility of JS.

The basic call is: 

var myClosure = Overloader(defaultMethod, argumentTypes, overloadMethod, argumen...);

See test.js for a more elaborate example.
